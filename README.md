A websocket based lightweight pub/sub message bus for both backend and frontend events and actions

This project originated from [Message Bus service for CasaOS](https://github.com/iceWhaleTech/CasaOS-messagebus). The message bus works very well for the project, which became the motivation of making it more generic so it can be re-used somewhere else.
